        """Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is :class:`Estimator` used for unsupervised learning.

        Amazon SageMaker Latent Dirichlet Allocation is an unsupervised
        learning algorithm that attempts to describe a set of observations as a
        mixture of distinct categories. LDA is most commonly used to discover a
        user-specified number of topics shared by documents within a text
        corpus. Here each observation is a document, the features are the
        presence (or occurrence count) of each word, and the categories are the
        topics.

        This Estimator may be fit via calls to
        :meth:`~sagemaker.amazon.amazon_estimator.AmazonAlgorithmEstimatorBase.fit`.
        It requires Amazon :class:`~sagemaker.amazon.record_pb2.Record` protobuf
        serialized data to be stored in S3. There is an utility
        :meth:`~sagemaker.amazon.amazon_estimator.AmazonAlgorithmEstimatorBase.record_set`
        that can be used to upload data to S3 and creates
        :class:`~sagemaker.amazon.amazon_estimator.RecordSet` to be passed to
        the `fit` call.

        To learn more about the Amazon protobuf Record class and how to
        prepare bulk data in this format, please consult AWS technical
        documentation:
        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/cdf-training.html

        After this Estimator is fit, model data is stored in S3. The model
        may be deployed to an Amazon SageMaker Endpoint by invoking
        :meth:`~sagemaker.amazon.estimator.EstimatorBase.deploy`. As well as
        deploying an Endpoint, deploy returns a
        :class:`~sagemaker.amazon.lda.LDAPredictor` object that can be used for
        inference calls using the trained model hosted in the SageMaker
        Endpoint.

        LDA Estimators can be configured by setting hyperparameters. The
        available hyperparameters for LDA are documented below.

        For further information on the AWS LDA algorithm, please consult AWS
        technical documentation:
