        An unsupervised algorithm that learns usage patterns of IP addresses.

        This Estimator may be fit via calls to
        :meth:`~sagemaker.amazon.amazon_estimator.AmazonAlgorithmEstimatorBase.fit`.
        It requires CSV data to be stored in S3.

        After this Estimator is fit, model data is stored in S3. The model
        may be deployed to an Amazon SageMaker Endpoint by invoking
        :meth:`~sagemaker.amazon.estimator.EstimatorBase.deploy`. As well as
        deploying an Endpoint, deploy returns a
        :class:`~sagemaker.amazon.IPInsightPredictor` object that can be used
        for inference calls using the trained model hosted in the SageMaker
        Endpoint.

        IPInsights Estimators can be configured by setting hyperparamters.
        The available hyperparamters are documented below.

        For further information on the AWS IPInsights algorithm, please
        consult AWS technical documentation:
        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ip-insights-hyperparameters.html

        Args:
            role (str): An AWS IAM role (either name or full ARN). The Amazon
                SageMaker training jobs and APIs that create Amazon SageMaker
                endpoints use this role to access training data and model
                artifacts. After the endpoint is created, the inference code
                might use the IAM role, if accessing AWS resource.
            instance_count (int or PipelineVariable): Number of Amazon EC2 instances to use
                for training.
            instance_type (str or PipelineVariable): Type of EC2 instance to use for training,
                for example, 'ml.m5.xlarge'.
            num_entity_vectors (int): Required. The number of embeddings to
                train for entities accessing online resources. We recommend 2x
                the total number of unique entity IDs.
            vector_dim (int): Required. The size of the embedding vectors for
                both entity and IP addresses.
            batch_metrics_publish_interval (int): Optional. The period at which
                to publish metrics (batches).
            epochs (int): Optional. Maximum number of passes over the training
                data.
            learning_rate (float): Optional. Learning rate for the optimizer.
            num_ip_encoder_layers (int): Optional. The number of fully-connected
                layers to encode IP address embedding.
            random_negative_sampling_rate (int): Optional. The ratio of random
                negative samples to draw during training. Random negative
                samples are randomly drawn IPv4 addresses.
            shuffled_negative_sampling_rate (int): Optional. The ratio of
                shuffled negative samples to draw during training. Shuffled
                negative samples are IP addresses picked from within a batch.
            weight_decay (float): Optional. Weight decay coefficient. Adds L2
                regularization.
            **kwargs: base class keyword argument values.
