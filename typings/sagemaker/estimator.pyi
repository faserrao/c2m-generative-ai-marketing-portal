        """Initialize an ``EstimatorBase`` instance.

        Args:
            role (str): An AWS IAM role (either name or full ARN). The Amazon
                SageMaker training jobs and APIs that create Amazon SageMaker
                endpoints use this role to access training data and model
                artifacts. After the endpoint is created, the inference code
                might use the IAM role, if it needs to access an AWS resource.
            instance_count (int or PipelineVariable): Number of Amazon EC2 instances to use
                for training. Required if instance_groups is not set.
            instance_type (str or PipelineVariable): Type of EC2 instance to use for training,
                for example, ``'ml.c4.xlarge'``. Required if instance_groups is
                not set.
            keep_alive_period_in_seconds (int): The duration of time in seconds
                to retain configured resources in a warm pool for subsequent
                training jobs (default: None).
            volume_size (int or PipelineVariable): Size in GB of the storage volume to use for
                storing input and output data during training (default: 30).

                Must be large enough to store training data if File mode is
                used, which is the default mode.

                When you use an ML instance with the EBS-only storage option
                such as ``ml.c5`` and ``ml.p2``,
                you must define the size of the EBS
                volume through the ``volume_size`` parameter in the estimator class.

                .. note::

                    When you use an ML instance with `NVMe SSD volumes
                    <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-instance-store.html#nvme-ssd-volumes>`_
                    such as ``ml.p4d``, ``ml.g4dn``, and ``ml.g5``,
                    do not include this parameter in the estimator configuration.
                    If you use one of those ML instance types,
                    SageMaker doesn't provision Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD
                    (gp2) storage nor take this parameter to adjust the NVMe instance storage.
                    Available storage is fixed to the NVMe instance storage
                    capacity. SageMaker configures storage paths for training
                    datasets, checkpoints, model artifacts, and outputs to use the
                    entire capacity of the instance storage.

                    Note that if you include this parameter and specify a number that
                    exceeds the size of the NVMe volume attached to the instance type,
                    SageMaker returns an ``Invalid VolumeSizeInGB`` error.

                To look up instance types and their instance storage types
                and volumes, see `Amazon EC2 Instance Types
                <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/>`_.

                To find the default local paths defined by the SageMaker
                training platform, see `Amazon SageMaker Training Storage
                Folders for Training Datasets, Checkpoints, Model Artifacts,
                and Outputs
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-train-storage.html>`_.
            volume_kms_key (str or PipelineVariable): Optional. KMS key ID for encrypting EBS
                volume attached to the training instance (default: None).
            max_run (int or PipelineVariable): Timeout in seconds for training (default: 24 *
                60 * 60). After this amount of time Amazon SageMaker terminates
                the job regardless of its current status.
            input_mode (str or PipelineVariable): The input mode that the algorithm supports
                (default: 'File'). Valid modes:
                'File' - Amazon SageMaker copies the training dataset from the
                S3 location to a local directory.
                'Pipe' - Amazon SageMaker streams data directly from S3 to the
                container via a Unix-named pipe.
                'FastFile' - Amazon SageMaker streams data from S3 on demand instead of
                downloading the entire dataset before training begins. This argument can
                be overriden on a per-channel basis using
                ``sagemaker.inputs.TrainingInput.input_mode``.
            output_path (str or PipelineVariable): S3 location for saving the training result (model
                artifacts and output files). If not specified, results are
                stored to a default bucket. If the bucket with the specific name
                does not exist, the estimator creates the bucket during the
                :meth:`~sagemaker.estimator.EstimatorBase.fit` method execution.
                file:// urls are used for local mode. For example: 'file://model/'
                will save to the model folder in the current directory.
            output_kms_key (str or PipelineVariable): Optional. KMS key ID for encrypting the
                training output (default: Your IAM role's KMS key for Amazon S3).
                If you don't provide a KMS key ID, Amazon SageMaker uses the
                default KMS key for Amazon S3 of the account linked to your
                IAM role.
            base_job_name (str): Prefix for training job name when the
                :meth:`~sagemaker.estimator.EstimatorBase.fit` method launches.
                If not specified, the estimator generates a default job name
                based on the training image name and current timestamp.
            sagemaker_session (sagemaker.session.Session): Session object which
                manages interactions with Amazon SageMaker APIs and any other
                AWS services needed. If not specified, the estimator creates one
                using the default AWS configuration chain.
            tags (list[dict[str, str] or list[dict[str, PipelineVariable]]):
                List of tags for labeling a training job. For more, see
                https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_Tag.html.
            subnets (list[str] or list[PipelineVariable]): List of subnet ids. If not
                specified training job will be created without VPC config.
            security_group_ids (list[str] or list[PipelineVariable]): List of security group ids.
                If not specified training job will be created without VPC config.
            model_uri (str): URI where a pre-trained model is stored, either
                locally or in S3 (default: None). If specified, the estimator
                will create a channel pointing to the model so the training job
                can download it. This model can be a 'model.tar.gz' from a
                previous training job, or other artifacts coming from a
                different source.

                In local mode, this should point to the path in which the model
                is located and not the file itself, as local Docker containers
                will try to mount the URI as a volume.

                More information:
                https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/cdf-training.html#td-deserialization
            model_channel_name (str or PipelineVariable): Name of the channel where 'model_uri' will
                be downloaded (default: 'model').
            metric_definitions (list[dict[str, str] or list[dict[str, PipelineVariable]]):
                A list of dictionaries that defines the metric(s) used to evaluate the
                training jobs. Each dictionary contains two keys: 'Name' for the name of the metric,
                and 'Regex' for the regular expression used to extract the
                metric from the logs. This should be defined only for jobs that
                don't use an Amazon algorithm.
            encrypt_inter_container_traffic (bool or PipelineVariable): Specifies whether traffic
                between training containers is encrypted for the training job
                (default: ``False``).
            use_spot_instances (bool or PipelineVariable): Specifies whether to use SageMaker
                Managed Spot instances for training. If enabled then the
                ``max_wait`` arg should also be set.
                More information:
                https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-managed-spot-training.html
                (default: ``False``).
            max_wait (int or PipelineVariable): Timeout in seconds waiting for spot training
                job (default: None). After this amount of time Amazon
                SageMaker will stop waiting for managed spot training job to
                complete (default: None).
            checkpoint_s3_uri (str or PipelineVariable): The S3 URI in which to persist checkpoints
                that the algorithm persists (if any) during training. (default:
                ``None``).
            checkpoint_local_path (str or PipelineVariable): The local path that the algorithm
                writes its checkpoints to. SageMaker will persist all files
                under this path to `checkpoint_s3_uri` continually during
                training. On job startup the reverse happens - data from the
                s3 location is downloaded to this path before the algorithm is
                started. If the path is unset then SageMaker assumes the
                checkpoints will be provided under `/opt/ml/checkpoints/`.
                (default: None).
            rules (list[:class:`~sagemaker.debugger.RuleBase`]): A list of
                :class:`~sagemaker.debugger.RuleBase` objects used to define
                SageMaker Debugger rules for real-time analysis
                (default: ``None``). For more information,
                see `Continuous analyses through rules
                <https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/amazon_sagemaker_debugger.html
                #continuous-analyses-through-rules)>`_.
            debugger_hook_config (:class:`~sagemaker.debugger.DebuggerHookConfig` or bool):
                Configuration for how debugging information is emitted with
                SageMaker Debugger. If not specified, a default one is created using
                the estimator's ``output_path``, unless the region does not
                support SageMaker Debugger. To disable SageMaker Debugger,
                set this parameter to ``False``. For more information, see
                `Capture real-time debugging data during model training in Amazon SageMaker

            tensorboard_output_config (:class:`~sagemaker.debugger.TensorBoardOutputConfig`):
                Configuration for customizing debugging visualization using TensorBoard
                (default: None). For more information,
                see `Capture real time tensorboard data
                <https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/amazon_sagemaker_debugger.html#
                capture-real-time-tensorboard-data-from-the-debugging-hook>`_.
            enable_sagemaker_metrics (bool or PipelineVariable): enable SageMaker Metrics Time
                Series. For more information, see `AlgorithmSpecification API
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/
                API_AlgorithmSpecification.html#SageMaker-Type-AlgorithmSpecification-
                EnableSageMakerMetricsTimeSeries>`_.
                (default: None).
            enable_network_isolation (bool or PipelineVariable): Specifies whether container will
                run in network isolation mode (default: ``False``). Network
                isolation mode restricts the container access to outside networks
                (such as the Internet). The container does not make any inbound or
                outbound network calls. Also known as Internet-free mode.
            profiler_config (:class:`~sagemaker.debugger.ProfilerConfig`):
                Configuration for how SageMaker Debugger collects
                monitoring and profiling information from your training job.
                If not specified, a default configuration is created using
                the estimator's ``output_path``, unless the region does not
                support SageMaker Debugger. To disable SageMaker Debugger
                monitoring and profiling, set the
                ``disable_profiler`` parameter to ``True``.
            disable_profiler (bool): Specifies whether Debugger monitoring and profiling
                will be disabled (default: ``False``).
            environment (dict[str, str] or dict[str, PipelineVariable]) : Environment variables
                to be set for use during training job (default: None)
            max_retry_attempts (int or PipelineVariable): The number of times to move a job
                to the STARTING status. You can specify between 1 and 30 attempts.
                If the value of attempts is greater than zero,
                the job is retried on InternalServerFailure
                the same number of attempts as the value.
                You can cap the total duration for your job by setting ``max_wait`` and ``max_run``
                (default: None)
            source_dir (str or PipelineVariable): The absolute, relative, or S3 URI Path to
                a directory with any other training source code dependencies aside from the entry
                point file (default: None). If ``source_dir`` is an S3 URI, it must
                point to a tar.gz file. The structure within this directory is preserved
                when training on Amazon SageMaker. If 'git_config' is provided,
                'source_dir' should be a relative location to a directory in the Git
                repo.
                With the following GitHub repo directory structure:

                .. code::

                    |----- README.md
                    |----- src
                             |----- train.py
                             |----- test.py

                if you need 'train.py' as the entry point and 'test.py' as
                the training source code, you can assign
                entry_point='train.py' and source_dir='src'.
            git_config (dict[str, str]): Git configurations used for cloning
                files, including ``repo``, ``branch``, ``commit``,
                ``2FA_enabled``, ``username``, ``password``, and ``token``. The
                ``repo`` field is required. All other fields are optional.
                ``repo`` specifies the Git repository where your training script
                is stored. If you don't provide ``branch``, the default value
                'master' is used. If you don't provide ``commit``, the latest
                commit in the specified branch is used. For example, the following config:

                .. code:: python

                    git_config = {
                        'repo': 'https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk.git',
                        'branch': 'test-branch-git-config',
                        'commit': '329bfcf884482002c05ff7f44f62599ebc9f445a'
                    }

                results in cloning the repo specified in 'repo', then
                checking out the 'master' branch, and checking out the specified
                commit.
                ``2FA_enabled``, ``username``, ``password``, and ``token`` are
                used for authentication. For GitHub (or other Git) accounts, set
                ``2FA_enabled`` to 'True' if two-factor authentication is
                enabled for the account, otherwise set it to 'False'. If you do
                not provide a value for ``2FA_enabled``, a default value of
                'False' is used. CodeCommit does not support two-factor
                authentication, so do not provide "2FA_enabled" with CodeCommit
                repositories.

                For GitHub and other Git repos, when SSH URLs are provided, it
                doesn't matter whether 2FA is enabled or disabled. You should
                either have no passphrase for the SSH key pairs or have the
                ssh-agent configured so that you will not be prompted for the SSH
                passphrase when you run the 'git clone' command with SSH URLs. When
                HTTPS URLs are provided, if 2FA is disabled, then either ``token``
                or ``username`` and ``password`` are be used for authentication if provided.
                ``Token`` is prioritized. If 2FA is enabled, only ``token`` is used
                for authentication if provided. If required authentication info
                is not provided, the SageMaker Python SDK attempts to use local credentials
                to authenticate. If that fails, an error message is thrown.

                For CodeCommit repos, 2FA is not supported, so '2FA_enabled'
                should not be provided. There is no token in CodeCommit, so
                ``token`` should also not be provided. When ``repo`` is an SSH URL,
                the requirements are the same as GitHub  repos. When ``repo``
                is an HTTPS URL, ``username`` and ``password`` are used for
                authentication if they are provided. If they are not provided,
                the SageMaker Python SDK attempts to use either the CodeCommit
                credential helper or local credential storage for authentication.
            hyperparameters (dict[str, str] or dict[str, PipelineVariable]):
                A dictionary containing the hyperparameters to
                initialize this estimator with. (Default: None).

                .. caution::
                    You must not include any security-sensitive information, such as
                    account access IDs, secrets, and tokens, in the dictionary for configuring
                    hyperparameters. SageMaker rejects the training job request and returns an
                    validation error for detected credentials, if such user input is found.

            container_log_level (int or PipelineVariable): The log level to use within the container
                (default: logging.INFO). Valid values are defined in the Python
                logging module.
            code_location (str): The S3 prefix URI where custom code is
                uploaded (default: None). You must not include a trailing slash because
                a string prepended with a "/" is appended to ``code_location``. The code
                file uploaded to S3 is 'code_location/job-name/source/sourcedir.tar.gz'.
                If not specified, the default ``code location`` is 's3://output_bucket/job-name/'.
            entry_point (str or PipelineVariable): The absolute or relative path to the local Python
                source file that should be executed as the entry point to
                training. (Default: None). If ``source_dir`` is specified, then ``entry_point``
                must point to a file located at the root of ``source_dir``.
                If 'git_config' is provided, 'entry_point' should be
                a relative location to the Python source file in the Git repo.

                Example:
                    With the following GitHub repo directory structure:

                    >>> |----- README.md
                    >>> |----- src
                    >>>         |----- train.py
                    >>>         |----- test.py

                    You can assign entry_point='src/train.py'.
            dependencies (list[str]): A list of absolute or relative paths to directories
                with any additional libraries that should be exported
                to the container (default: []). The library folders are
                copied to SageMaker in the same folder where the entrypoint is
                copied. If 'git_config' is provided, 'dependencies' should be a
                list of relative locations to directories with any additional
                libraries needed in the Git repo.

                .. admonition:: Example

                    The following Estimator call:

                    >>> Estimator(entry_point='train.py',
                    ...           dependencies=['my/libs/common', 'virtual-env'])

                    results in the following structure inside the container:

                    >>> $ ls

                    >>> opt/ml/code
                    >>>     |------ train.py
                    >>>     |------ common
                    >>>     |------ virtual-env

                This is not supported with "local code" in Local Mode.
            instance_groups (list[:class:`sagemaker.instance_group.InstanceGroup`]):
                Optional. A list of ``InstanceGroup`` objects
                for launching a training job with a heterogeneous cluster.
                For example:

                .. code:: python

                    instance_groups=[
                        sagemaker.InstanceGroup(
                            'instance_group_name_1', 'ml.p3dn.24xlarge', 64),
                        sagemaker.InstanceGroup(
                            'instance_group_name_2', 'ml.c5n.18xlarge', 64)]

                For instructions on how to use ``InstanceGroup`` objects
                to configure a heterogeneous cluster
                through the SageMaker generic and framework estimator classes, see
                `Train Using a Heterogeneous Cluster
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/train-heterogeneous-cluster.html>`_
                in the *Amazon SageMaker developer guide*.
            training_repository_access_mode (str): Optional. Specifies how SageMaker accesses the
                Docker image that contains the training algorithm (default: None).
                Set this to one of the following values:
                * 'Platform' - The training image is hosted in Amazon ECR.
                * 'Vpc' - The training image is hosted in a private Docker registry in your VPC.
                When it's default to None, its behavior will be same as 'Platform' - image is hosted
                in ECR.
            training_repository_credentials_provider_arn (str): Optional. The Amazon Resource Name
                (ARN) of an AWS Lambda function that provides credentials to authenticate to the
                private Docker registry where your training image is hosted (default: None).
                When it's set to None, SageMaker will not do authentication before pulling the image
                in the private Docker registry.
            container_entry_point (List[str]): Optional. The entrypoint script for a Docker
                container used to run a training job. This script takes precedence over
                the default train processing instructions.
            container_arguments (List[str]): Optional. The arguments for a container used to run
                a training job.
            disable_output_compression (bool): Optional. When set to true, Model is uploaded
                to Amazon S3 without compression after training finishes.
            enable_infra_check (bool or PipelineVariable): Optional.
                Specifies whether it is running Sagemaker built-in infra check jobs.

        CreatingTrainingJob request to Amazon SageMaker.

        This is a synchronous operation. After the model training
        successfully completes, you can call the ``deploy()`` method to host the

                    the path to the training dataset.

            wait (bool): Whether the call should wait until the job completes (default: True).
            logs ([str]): A list of strings specifying which logs to print. Acceptable
                strings are "All", "None", "Training", or "Rules". To maintain backwards
                compatibility, boolean values are also accepted and converted to strings.
                Only meaningful when wait is True.
            job_name (str): Training job name. If not specified, the estimator generates
                a default job name based on the training image name and current timestamp.
            experiment_config (dict[str, str]): Experiment management configuration.

        Args:
            image_uri (str or PipelineVariable): The container image to use for training.
            role (str): An AWS IAM role (either name or full ARN). The Amazon
                SageMaker training jobs and APIs that create Amazon SageMaker
                endpoints use this role to access training data and model
                artifacts. After the endpoint is created, the inference code
                might use the IAM role, if it needs to access an AWS resource.
            instance_count (int or PipelineVariable): Number of Amazon EC2 instances to use
                for training. Required if instance_groups is not set.
            instance_type (str or PipelineVariable): Type of EC2 instance to use for training,
                for example, ``'ml.c4.xlarge'``. Required if instance_groups is
                not set.
            keep_alive_period_in_seconds (int): The duration of time in seconds
                to retain configured resources in a warm pool for subsequent
                training jobs (default: None).
            volume_size (int or PipelineVariable): Size in GB of the storage volume to use for
                storing input and output data during training (default: 30).

                Must be large enough to store training data if File mode is
                used, which is the default mode.

                When you use an ML instance with the EBS-only storage option
                such as ``ml.c5`` and ``ml.p2``,
                you must define the size of the EBS
                volume through the ``volume_size`` parameter in the estimator class.

                .. note::

                    When you use an ML instance with `NVMe SSD volumes
                    <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-instance-store.html#nvme-ssd-volumes>`_
                    such as ``ml.p4d``, ``ml.g4dn``, and ``ml.g5``,
                    do not include this parameter in the estimator configuration.
                    If you use one of those ML instance types,
                    SageMaker doesn't provision Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD
                    (gp2) storage nor take this parameter to adjust the NVMe instance storage.
                    Available storage is fixed to the NVMe instance storage
                    capacity. SageMaker configures storage paths for training
                    datasets, checkpoints, model artifacts, and outputs to use the
                    entire capacity of the instance storage.

                    Note that if you include this parameter and specify a number that
                    exceeds the size of the NVMe volume attached to the instance type,
                    SageMaker returns an ``Invalid VolumeSizeInGB`` error.

                To look up instance types and their instance storage types
                and volumes, see `Amazon EC2 Instance Types
                <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/>`_.

                To find the default local paths defined by the SageMaker
                training platform, see `Amazon SageMaker Training Storage
                Folders for Training Datasets, Checkpoints, Model Artifacts,
                and Outputs
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-train-storage.html>`_.
            volume_kms_key (str or PipelineVariable): Optional. KMS key ID for encrypting EBS
                volume attached to the training instance (default: None).
            max_run (int or PipelineVariable): Timeout in seconds for training (default: 24 *
                60 * 60). After this amount of time Amazon SageMaker terminates
                the job regardless of its current status.
            input_mode (str or PipelineVariable): The input mode that the algorithm supports
                (default: 'File'). Valid modes:

                * 'File' - Amazon SageMaker copies the training dataset from the
                  S3 location to a local directory.
                * 'Pipe' - Amazon SageMaker streams data directly from S3 to the
                  container via a Unix-named pipe.

                This argument can be overriden on a per-channel basis using
                ``sagemaker.inputs.TrainingInput.input_mode``.
            output_path (str or PipelineVariable): S3 location for saving the training result
                (model artifacts and output files). If not specified, results are
                stored to a default bucket. If the bucket with the specific name
                does not exist, the estimator creates the bucket during the
                :meth:`~sagemaker.estimator.EstimatorBase.fit` method execution.
            output_kms_key (str or PipelineVariable): Optional. KMS key ID for encrypting the
                training output (default: None).
            base_job_name (str): Prefix for training job name when the
                :meth:`~sagemaker.estimator.EstimatorBase.fit` method launches.
                If not specified, the estimator generates a default job name,
                based on the training image name and current timestamp.
            sagemaker_session (sagemaker.session.Session): Session object which
                manages interactions with Amazon SageMaker APIs and any other
                AWS services needed. If not specified, the estimator creates one
                using the default AWS configuration chain.
            hyperparameters (dict[str, str] or dict[str, PipelineVariable]):
                Dictionary containing the hyperparameters to initialize this estimator with.

                .. caution::
                    You must not include any security-sensitive information, such as
                    account access IDs, secrets, and tokens, in the dictionary for configuring
                    hyperparameters. SageMaker rejects the training job request and returns an
                    validation error for detected credentials, if such user input is found.

            tags (list[dict[str, str] or list[dict[str, PipelineVariable]]): List of tags for
                labeling a training job. For more, see
                https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_Tag.html.
            subnets (list[str] or list[PipelineVariable]): List of subnet ids.
                If not specified training job will be created without VPC config.
            security_group_ids (list[str] or list[PipelineVariable]): List of security group ids.
                If not specified training job will be created without VPC config.
            model_uri (str): URI where a pre-trained model is stored, either
                locally or in S3 (default: None). If specified, the estimator
                will create a channel pointing to the model so the training job
                can download it. This model can be a 'model.tar.gz' from a
                previous training job, or other artifacts coming from a
                different source.

                In local mode, this should point to the path in which the model
                is located and not the file itself, as local Docker containers
                will try to mount the URI as a volume.

                More information:
                https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/cdf-training.html#td-deserialization
            model_channel_name (str or PipelineVariable): Name of the channel where 'model_uri' will
                be downloaded (default: 'model').
            metric_definitions (list[dict[str, str] or list[dict[str, PipelineVariable]]): A list of
                dictionaries that defines the metric(s) used to evaluate the training jobs. Each
                dictionary contains two keys: 'Name' for the name of the metric,
                and 'Regex' for the regular expression used to extract the
                metric from the logs. This should be defined only for jobs that
                don't use an Amazon algorithm.
            encrypt_inter_container_traffic (bool or PipelineVariable): Specifies whether traffic
                between training containers is encrypted for the training job
                (default: ``False``).
            use_spot_instances (bool or PipelineVariable): Specifies whether to use SageMaker
                Managed Spot instances for training. If enabled then the
                ``max_wait`` arg should also be set.

                More information:
                https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-managed-spot-training.html
                (default: ``False``).
            max_wait (int or PipelineVariable): Timeout in seconds waiting for spot training
                job (default: None). After this amount of time Amazon
                SageMaker will stop waiting for managed spot training job to
                complete (default: None).
            checkpoint_s3_uri (str or PipelineVariable): The S3 URI in which to persist checkpoints
                that the algorithm persists (if any) during training. (default:
                None).
            checkpoint_local_path (str or PipelineVariable): The local path that the algorithm
                writes its checkpoints to. SageMaker will persist all files
                under this path to `checkpoint_s3_uri` continually during
                training. On job startup the reverse happens - data from the
                s3 location is downloaded to this path before the algorithm is
                started. If the path is unset then SageMaker assumes the
                checkpoints will be provided under `/opt/ml/checkpoints/`.
                (default: None).
            enable_network_isolation (bool or PipelineVariable): Specifies whether container will
                run in network isolation mode (default: ``False``). Network
                isolation mode restricts the container access to outside networks
                (such as the Internet). The container does not make any inbound or
                outbound network calls. Also known as Internet-free mode.
            rules (list[:class:`~sagemaker.debugger.RuleBase`]): A list of
                :class:`~sagemaker.debugger.RuleBase` objects used to define
                SageMaker Debugger rules for real-time analysis
                (default: None). For more information,
                see `Continuous analyses through rules
                <https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/amazon_sagemaker_debugger.html
                #continuous-analyses-through-rules)>`_.
            debugger_hook_config (:class:`~sagemaker.debugger.DebuggerHookConfig` or bool):
                Configuration for how debugging information is emitted with
                SageMaker Debugger. If not specified, a default one is created using
                the estimator's ``output_path``, unless the region does not
                support SageMaker Debugger. To disable SageMaker Debugger,
                set this parameter to ``False``. For more information, see
                `Capture real-time debugging data during model training in Amazon SageMaker

            enable_sagemaker_metrics (bool or PipelineVariable): enable SageMaker Metrics Time
                Series. For more information, see `AlgorithmSpecification API
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/

                (default: None).
            profiler_config (:class:`~sagemaker.debugger.ProfilerConfig`):
                Configuration for how SageMaker Debugger collects
                monitoring and profiling information from your training job.
                If not specified, Debugger will be configured with
                a default configuration and will save system and framework metrics
                the estimator's default ``output_path`` in Amazon S3.
                Use :class:`~sagemaker.debugger.ProfilerConfig` to configure this parameter.
                To disable SageMaker Debugger monitoring and profiling, set the
                ``disable_profiler`` parameter to ``True``.
            disable_profiler (bool): Specifies whether Debugger monitoring and profiling
                will be disabled (default: ``False``).
            environment (dict[str, str] or dict[str, PipelineVariable]) : Environment variables to
                be set for use during training job (default: None)
            max_retry_attempts (int or PipelineVariable): The number of times to move a job
                to the STARTING status. You can specify between 1 and 30 attempts.
                If the value of attempts is greater than zero,
                the job is retried on InternalServerFailure
                the same number of attempts as the value.
                You can cap the total duration for your job by setting ``max_wait`` and ``max_run``
                (default: None)
            source_dir (str or PipelineVariable): The absolute, relative, or S3 URI Path to
                a directory with any other training source code dependencies aside from the entry
                point file (default: None). If ``source_dir`` is an S3 URI, it must
                point to a tar.gz file. Structure within this directory is preserved
                when training on Amazon SageMaker. If 'git_config' is provided,
                'source_dir' should be a relative location to a directory in the Git
                repo.

                .. admonition:: Example

                    With the following GitHub repo directory structure:

                    >>> |----- README.md
                    >>> |----- src
                    >>>         |----- train.py
                    >>>         |----- test.py

                    if you need 'train.py'
                    as the entry point and 'test.py' as the training source code, you can assign
                    entry_point='train.py', source_dir='src'.
            git_config (dict[str, str]): Git configurations used for cloning
                files, including ``repo``, ``branch``, ``commit``,
                ``2FA_enabled``, ``username``, ``password`` and ``token``. The
                ``repo`` field is required. All other fields are optional.
                ``repo`` specifies the Git repository where your training script
                is stored. If you don't provide ``branch``, the default value
                'master' is used. If you don't provide ``commit``, the latest
                commit in the specified branch is used.

                .. admonition:: Example

                    The following config:

                    >>> git_config = {'repo': 'https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk.git',
                    >>>               'branch': 'test-branch-git-config',
                    >>>               'commit': '329bfcf884482002c05ff7f44f62599ebc9f445a'}

                    results in cloning the repo specified in 'repo', then
                    checking out the 'master' branch, and checking out the specified
                    commit.

                ``2FA_enabled``, ``username``, ``password`` and ``token`` are
                used for authentication. For GitHub (or other Git) accounts, set
                ``2FA_enabled`` to 'True' if two-factor authentication is
                enabled for the account, otherwise set it to 'False'. If you do
                not provide a value for ``2FA_enabled``, a default value of
                'False' is used. CodeCommit does not support two-factor
                authentication, so do not provide "2FA_enabled" with CodeCommit
                repositories.

                For GitHub and other Git repos, when SSH URLs are provided, it
                doesn't matter whether 2FA is enabled or disabled. You should
                either have no passphrase for the SSH key pairs or have the
                ssh-agent configured so that you will not be prompted for the SSH
                passphrase when you run the 'git clone' command with SSH URLs. When
                HTTPS URLs are provided, if 2FA is disabled, then either ``token``
                or ``username`` and ``password`` are be used for authentication if provided.
                ``Token`` is prioritized. If 2FA is enabled, only ``token`` is used
                for authentication if provided. If required authentication info
                is not provided, the SageMaker Python SDK attempts to use local credentials
                to authenticate. If that fails, an error message is thrown.

                For CodeCommit repos, 2FA is not supported, so ``2FA_enabled``
                should not be provided. There is no token in CodeCommit, so
                ``token`` should also not be provided. When ``repo`` is an SSH URL,
                the requirements are the same as GitHub  repos. When ``repo``
                is an HTTPS URL, ``username`` and ``password`` are used for
                authentication if they are provided. If they are not provided,
                the SageMaker Python SDK attempts to use either the CodeCommit
                credential helper or local credential storage for authentication.
            container_log_level (int or PipelineVariable): The log level to use within the container
                (default: logging.INFO). Valid values are defined in the Python
                logging module.
            code_location (str): The S3 prefix URI where custom code is
                uploaded (default: None). You must not include a trailing slash because
                a string prepended with a "/" is appended to ``code_location``. The code
                file uploaded to S3 is 'code_location/job-name/source/sourcedir.tar.gz'.
                If not specified, the default ``code location`` is 's3://output_bucket/job-name/'.
            entry_point (str or PipelineVariable): The absolute or relative path to the local Python
                source file that should be executed as the entry point to
                training. If ``source_dir`` is specified, then ``entry_point``
                must point to a file located at the root of ``source_dir``.
                If 'git_config' is provided, 'entry_point' should be
                a relative location to the Python source file in the Git repo.

                Example:
                    With the following GitHub repo directory structure:

                    >>> |----- README.md
                    >>> |----- src
                    >>>         |----- train.py
                    >>>         |----- test.py

                    You can assign entry_point='src/train.py'.
            dependencies (list[str]): A list of absolute or relative paths to directories
                with any additional libraries that should be exported
                to the container (default: []). The library folders are
                copied to SageMaker in the same folder where the entrypoint is
                copied. If 'git_config' is provided, 'dependencies' should be a
                list of relative locations to directories with any additional
                libraries needed in the Git repo.

                .. admonition:: Example

                    The following Estimator call:

                    >>> Estimator(entry_point='train.py',
                    ...           dependencies=['my/libs/common', 'virtual-env'])

                    results in the following structure inside the container:

                    >>> $ ls

                    >>> opt/ml/code
                    >>>     |------ train.py
                    >>>     |------ common
                    >>>     |------ virtual-env

                This is not supported with "local code" in Local Mode.
            instance_groups (list[:class:`sagemaker.instance_group.InstanceGroup`]):
                Optional. A list of ``InstanceGroup`` objects
                for launching a training job with a heterogeneous cluster.
                For example:

                .. code:: python

                    instance_groups=[
                        sagemaker.InstanceGroup(
                            'instance_group_name_1', 'ml.p3dn.24xlarge', 64),
                        sagemaker.InstanceGroup(
                            'instance_group_name_2', 'ml.c5n.18xlarge', 64)]

                For instructions on how to use ``InstanceGroup`` objects
                to configure a heterogeneous cluster
                through the SageMaker generic and framework estimator classes, see
                `Train Using a Heterogeneous Cluster

                in the *Amazon SageMaker developer guide*.
            training_repository_access_mode (str): Optional. Specifies how SageMaker accesses the
                Docker image that contains the training algorithm (default: None).
                Set this to one of the following values:
                * 'Platform' - The training image is hosted in Amazon ECR.
                * 'Vpc' - The training image is hosted in a private Docker registry in your VPC.
                When it's default to None, its behavior will be same as 'Platform' - image is hosted
                in ECR.
            training_repository_credentials_provider_arn (str): Optional. The Amazon Resource Name
                (ARN) of an AWS Lambda function that provides credentials to authenticate to the
                private Docker registry where your training image is hosted (default: None).
                When it's set to None, SageMaker will not do authentication before pulling the image
                in the private Docker registry.
            container_entry_point (List[str]): Optional. The entrypoint script for a Docker
                container used to run a training job. This script takes precedence over
                the default train processing instructions.
            container_arguments (List[str]): Optional. The arguments for a container used to run
                a training job.
            disable_output_compression (bool): Optional. When set to true, Model is uploaded
                to Amazon S3 without compression after training finishes.
            enable_infra_check (bool or PipelineVariable): Optional.
                Specifies whether it is running Sagemaker built-in infra check jobs.

                    training source code as well, you can assign
                    entry_point='train.py', source_dir='src'.
            hyperparameters (dict[str, str] or dict[str, PipelineVariable]): Hyperparameters
                that will be used for training (default: None). The hyperparameters are made
                accessible as a dict[str, str] to the training code on

                .. caution::
                    You must not include any security-sensitive information, such as
                    account access IDs, secrets, and tokens, in the dictionary for configuring
                    hyperparameters. SageMaker rejects the training job request and returns an
                    validation error for detected credentials, if such user input is found.

            container_log_level (int or PipelineVariable): Log level to use within the container
                (default: logging.INFO). Valid values are defined in the Python
                logging module.
            code_location (str): The S3 prefix URI where custom code will be
                uploaded (default: None) - don't include a trailing slash since
                a string prepended with a "/" is appended to ``code_location``. The code
                file uploaded to S3 is 'code_location/job-name/source/sourcedir.tar.gz'.
                If not specified, the default ``code location`` is s3://output_bucket/job-name/.
            image_uri (str or PipelineVariable): An alternate image name to use instead of the
                official Sagemaker image for the framework. This is useful to
                run one of the Sagemaker supported frameworks with an image
                containing custom dependencies.
            dependencies (list[str]): A list of paths to directories (absolute
                or relative) with any additional libraries that will be exported
                to the container (default: []). The library folders will be
                copied to SageMaker in the same folder where the entrypoint is
                copied. If 'git_config' is provided, 'dependencies' should be a
                list of relative locations to directories with any additional
                libraries needed in the Git repo.

                    >>>     |------ virtual-env

                This is not supported with "local code" in Local Mode.
            enable_network_isolation (bool or PipelineVariable): Specifies whether container will
                run in network isolation mode. Network isolation mode restricts
                the container access to outside networks (such as the internet).
                The container does not make any inbound or outbound network
                calls. If True, a channel named "code" will be created for any
                user entry script for training. The user entry script, files in
                source_dir (if specified), and dependencies will be uploaded in
                a tar to S3. Also known as internet-free mode (default: `False`).
            git_config (dict[str, str]): Git configurations used for cloning
                files, including ``repo``, ``branch``, ``commit``,
                ``2FA_enabled``, ``username``, ``password`` and ``token``. The
                ``repo`` field is required. All other fields are optional.
                ``repo`` specifies the Git repository where your training script
                is stored. If you don't provide ``branch``, the default value
                'master' is used. If you don't provide ``commit``, the latest
                commit in the specified branch is used. .. admonition:: Example

                    The following config:

                    >>> git_config = {'repo': 'https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk.git',
                    >>>               'branch': 'test-branch-git-config',
                    >>>               'commit': '329bfcf884482002c05ff7f44f62599ebc9f445a'}

                    results in cloning the repo specified in 'repo', then
                    checkout the 'master' branch, and checkout the specified
                    commit.

                ``2FA_enabled``, ``username``, ``password`` and ``token`` are
                used for authentication. For GitHub (or other Git) accounts, set
                ``2FA_enabled`` to 'True' if two-factor authentication is
                enabled for the account, otherwise set it to 'False'. If you do
                not provide a value for ``2FA_enabled``, a default value of
                'False' is used. CodeCommit does not support two-factor
                authentication, so do not provide "2FA_enabled" with CodeCommit
                repositories.

                For GitHub and other Git repos, when SSH URLs are provided, it
                doesn't matter whether 2FA is enabled or disabled; you should
                either have no passphrase for the SSH key pairs, or have the
                ssh-agent configured so that you will not be prompted for SSH
                passphrase when you do 'git clone' command with SSH URLs. When
                HTTPS URLs are provided: if 2FA is disabled, then either token
                or username+password will be used for authentication if provided
                (token prioritized); if 2FA is enabled, only token will be used
                for authentication if provided. If required authentication info
                is not provided, python SDK will try to use local credentials
                storage to authenticate. If that fails either, an error message
                will be thrown.

                For CodeCommit repos, 2FA is not supported, so '2FA_enabled'
                should not be provided. There is no token in CodeCommit, so
                'token' should not be provided too. When 'repo' is an SSH URL,
                the requirements are the same as GitHub-like repos. When 'repo'
                is an HTTPS URL, username+password will be used for
                authentication if they are provided; otherwise, python SDK will
                try to use either CodeCommit credential helper or local
                credential storage for authentication.
            checkpoint_s3_uri (str or PipelineVariable): The S3 URI in which to persist checkpoints
                that the algorithm persists (if any) during training. (default:
                None).
            checkpoint_local_path (str or PipelineVariable): The local path that the algorithm
                writes its checkpoints to. SageMaker will persist all files
                under this path to `checkpoint_s3_uri` continually during
                training. On job startup the reverse happens - data from the
                s3 location is downloaded to this path before the algorithm is
                started. If the path is unset then SageMaker assumes the
                checkpoints will be provided under `/opt/ml/checkpoints/`.
                (default: None).
            enable_sagemaker_metrics (bool or PipelineVariable): enable SageMaker Metrics Time
