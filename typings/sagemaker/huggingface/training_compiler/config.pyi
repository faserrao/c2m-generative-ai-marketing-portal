        `Amazon SageMaker Training Compiler
        <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/training-compiler.html>`_
        is a feature of SageMaker Training
        and speeds up training jobs by optimizing model execution graphs.

        You can compile Hugging Face models
        by passing the object of this configuration class to the ``compiler_config``
        parameter of the :class:`~sagemaker.huggingface.HuggingFace`
        estimator.

        Args:
            enabled (bool or PipelineVariable): Optional. Switch to enable SageMaker
                Training Compiler. The default is ``True``.
            debug (bool or PipelineVariable): Optional. Whether to dump detailed logs
                for debugging. This comes with a potential performance slowdown.
                The default is ``False``.

        **Example**: The following code shows the basic usage of the
        :class:`sagemaker.huggingface.TrainingCompilerConfig()` class
        to run a HuggingFace training job with the compiler.

        .. code-block:: python

            from sagemaker.huggingface import HuggingFace, TrainingCompilerConfig

            huggingface_estimator=HuggingFace(
                ...
                compiler_config=TrainingCompilerConfig()
            )

        .. seealso::

            For more information about how to enable SageMaker Training Compiler
            for various training settings such as using TensorFlow-based models,
            PyTorch-based models, and distributed training,
